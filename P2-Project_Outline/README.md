For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our app, Discover MO Trails, is a trail finder/database. Our app helps you find nearby trails while providing relevant and useful information about those trails. You can make an account and will be able to post photos and comments to provide your personal experience and even more information than is already available on the app. If you make an account, you can log how long a hike was in time and/or distance, to track progress or compete with friends. You will find many different details about the trails such as emergency alerts, weather, if you can walk, run, or bike on a select trail, the trail length, traffic, comments, photos etc. You will be able to search for trails using the trail's name and/or filtering specific information about the trail.
